# API Service Standard 

## The API Standards are a set of 17 criteria to help government create and run good API Services. 

Before building your API we recommend you familiarise yourself with these Standards and [GDS API Standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards). An API is a user interface for developers and shouldn’t just be functional but simple to use. Further reading for those who hold a more technical role can be found in our API Technical Standards. All APIs must meet the Service and Technical Standards. 

### 1. Understand the needs of your API consumers
You must understand the needs of your API consumers by conducting research to develop knowledge of who they are and what that means for the design of the API and the associated documentation. You should think of an API as a “product” designed around user needs and user journeys.

### 2. Follow the API Service Process 
Every team developing APIs to be exposed on the API Platform must go through the API Service Process. This applies to all APIs, whether new or legacy, that are to be deployed on the API Platform. 

### 3. Do ongoing user research 
Put a plan in place for ongoing user research, simulations and API usability testing to continuously seek feedback from users to improve the service. You must run hackathons and engage with 3rd party developers early on in the process and throughout the lifecycle of the API. 

### 4. Have a multidisciplinary team 
Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and operate the API service, led by a suitably empowered product owner and supported by a business owner.

### 5. Use agile methods 
Build your API service using the agile, iterative and user-centered methods set out in the service manual. 

### 6. Iterate and improve your API frequently 
Iterate and improve your API on a frequent basis and make sure that you have the capacity, resources and technical flexibility to do so, whilst proactively managing the impact this will have on your consumers. Think about your plan for providing ongoing maintenance of your API after your "go live" date. 

### 7. Design your API following the technical standards
Principles let us meet the objectives defined in our strategy, they represent a way to steer architectural design over the course of time for an organisation. It is essential that you follow the architecture, principles and guidance in the technical standards.

### 8. Understand your Domain 
Good domain modelling allows for re-usability, is cost efficient, minimises duplication, encourages innovation and enhances the user experience for developers. You must also ensure you meet the data standards. It is essential that you follow the guidance in the technical standards.

### 9. Understand security and privacy issues 
Evaluate what data and information the API service will be providing or storing. Address the security level, legal responsibilities, privacy issues and risks associated with the API service (consulting with experts where appropriate). 

### 10. Make new source code open for your API 
Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences or provide a convincing explanation as to why this can't be done for specific subsets of the source code.

### 11. Tests and scenarios must be in the open 
Make all business scenario tests open to show how the API is orchestrated to achieve a business goal. API integration tests should be in the open to demonstrate adherence to technical standards such as error handling and integration to downstream systems. 

### 12. Use open standards and common platforms 
Use open standards and common government platforms where available.

### 13. Make a plan for being offline 
Make a plan for the event of the API being taken temporarily offline.

### 14. Have a capacity planning model in place for usage
The API Platform uses your capacity planning for future performance tests to ensure that it can meet your performance demands. This information must also be used to ensure the backend systems have the capacity. This must be refined over time into a forecast as use of the API increases.

### 15. Collect and use performance data 
Use tools for analysis that collect performance data. Use this data to analyse the success of the API service and to translate this into improvements and assess the impact on downstream services.

### 16. Produce comprehensive, self-describing documentation
API documentation is important because unlike a UI service there isn't an interface. The documentation tells the developer how to use your API and you must ensure this is clear and accurate.  

### 17. Understand the lifecycle of your API
Versioning your API is important as it lets developers know when there has been changes to the API.  Breaking changes will always result in a change to the major version number of an API. It is essential you follow the guidance in the technical standards.
